Update the Serenlio app so that all meditation, sleep, breathwork, and music content is explicitly voice-free and uses background audio only.

Make the following changes across the entire app:

1. Content descriptions:
   - Remove all references to narration, guidance, instructor voice, teacher voice, or spoken instructions.
   - Replace wording with terms like:
     - “background audio”
     - “ambient sound”
     - “music-only”
     - “voice-free”
     - “distraction-free audio”

2. Meditation descriptions:
   - Change any text such as “guided meditation” or “listen to the voice” to:
     - “calming background audio”
     - “ambient meditation sound”
   - Emphasize self-guided practice using sound only.

3. Sleep content:
   - Remove references to sleep stories, narration, or spoken guidance.
   - Use descriptions like:
     - “continuous ambient sound”
     - “voice-free sleep audio”
     - “designed to help you relax and fall asleep naturally”

4. Breathwork sessions:
   - Remove spoken breathing instructions from descriptions.
   - Instead:
     - Display breathing patterns visually or as on-screen text (e.g. “Inhale 4 · Hold 4 · Exhale 4 · Hold 4”)
     - Describe the audio as “background sound to support breathing”

5. UI labels and metadata:
   - Remove labels such as “guided,” “narrated,” “teacher-led,” or “voice”
   - Ensure all session metadata reflects music-only or ambient-only content

6. Teacher profiles:
   - If teacher or instructor profiles exist, either:
     - Remove them entirely, or
     - Update descriptions to clarify that content is “curated audio” rather than spoken instruction

7. Consistency check:
   - Ensure no part of the app implies spoken guidance if the audio contains no voice
   - The experience should clearly feel intentional: minimal, calm, voice-free

8. Positioning:
   - Frame the experience as:
     - “Pure ambient calm”
     - “Voice-free meditation and sleep”
     - “Distraction-free audio for relaxation, focus, and rest”

Do not change audio playback functionality.
Only update text, labels, descriptions, and any UI logic related to voice or guidance.
